# Match Result for all
## Anouncement
- I noticed that the websocket used in the original card-nim php server is not the correct form of websocket. So it can have unpredictable problems when sending long data. Considering the excessive effort required to refactor the php server. I currently have no plans to fix the GUI. If anyone is particularly interested in seeing the GUI results for particular matches, I will refactor the php server and run the corresponding match results in the future after I have free time.

- Also we did not receive the code froms Shuttlers, so the results of their matches in the table are indicates as "-".

- Because I noticed that many colleagues use random numbers in their codes, the following table is for reference only. So the results may be a little different from the matches in lecture.
